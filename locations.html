    <p>Mandu is a celebration in stone, of life and joy, and the love of poet-prince Baz Bahadur for his
        beautiful consort, Rani Roopmati. Perched along the Vindhya ranges at an altitude of 2,000 feet,
        Mandu has eclectic creations combining the charming assertion of the Afghan mode with the great
        cultural heritage of the Turkish people.
        Each of Mandu's structures is an architectural gem, like the massive Jami Masjid and Hoshang
        Shah's Tomb, which is believed to be the inspiration for the master builders of the Taj Mahal.
        Floating over its reflection, the Jahaz Mahal in Mandu looks like a ship that's about to sail.
        However, for centuries this ship made of stone and mortar never did. Instead, it stood floating over
        the twin lakes, bearing a silent witness to Mandu's long, rich and varied history.
        The grand palaces are still alive with royal romance while the gateways (Darwaza) speak about
        the history of imperial conquests.

    <p>The construction of Lal Bagh Palace, or the Red Palace, began in the late nineteenth century and
        was completed in 1926 by the Holkar dynasty, whose leaders were some of the most powerful
        Maratha rulers of India. The architecture reflects Italian Renaissance Revival style, making it one
        of India’s finest neoclassical buildings. It is renowned for its European-influenced interiors, among
        the finest surviving from this period in India. The garden can be reached through Lal Bagh’s vast
        entrance gates bearing the Holkar coat of arms.
        In the 1980s, the palace was handed over to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Since
        then, it has faced the challenges of a very minimal budget allocation. As a result, though it is
        reputed to have been the best garden palace in central India, Lal Bagh is today in dire need of
        conservation. Peeling plaster, damage to the roof, water infiltration, and the faded splendor of the
        richly furnished rooms all require urgent attention.</p>

    <p>The sculptures of Lord Hanuman are usually seen in a standing position. But at Pitra Parvat, you
        will see Lord Hanuman sitting in a meditative state. Worshipping Lord Hanuman in a sitting
        position is considered very rare and this is the reason most people visit this place. Moreover, there
        are two deities of Lord Hanuman established on the mountain Pitra Parvat. One is established for
        tourism and attrition & the other one is where devotees worship Lord Hanuman The one which is
        the major point of attraction here is 71 feet long and weighs 108 tons. Yes, this huge sculpture is
        made with 8 elements in golden color. It took 125 workers and 7 years to complete this huge
        beautiful deity of Lord Hanuman. It shines in bright golden color when the sun is in the sky and the
        same golden color looks utterly soothing and peaceful in the moonlight. Right below this huge
        sculpture has established a temple that has the small deity of Lord Hanuman for the devotees to
        worship. Lord Hanuman is seen sitting in the lap of Mother Anjani in this temple.</p>

    <p>Mahakala temple first come in existence, is difficult to tell. However, the event may be assigned to
        the Pre-historic period. Puranas narrate that it was first established by Prajapita Brahma. There is
        reference to the appointment of prince Kumarasena by king Chanda Pradyota in 6th c. BC for
        looking after the law and order situations of Mahakala temple. The punch-marked coins of Ujjain,
        belonging to 4th-3rd c. BC, bear the figure of Lord Siva on them.
        Mahakala temple is also mentioned in several ancient Indian poetic texts. According to these texts, the temple had been very magnificent and magnanimous.Its foundation and platform were built of stones. The temple rested on the wooden pillars.There had been no sikharas on the temples prior
        to the Gupta period. The roofs of temples had mostly been flat.Possibly due to this fact, Kalidasa in Raghuvansam described this temple as ‘Niketana’.The palace of the king had been in the
        vicinity of the temple. In the early part of the Meghadutam (Purva Megha),Kalidasa gives a
        fascinating description of the Mahakala temple.</p>
